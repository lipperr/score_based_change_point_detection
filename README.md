This repository containes code for numerical experiments and implementations of several online change point detection algorithms. The description of the experiments can be found in the paper "Score-based change point detection via tracking the best of infinitely many experts" by A. Markovich, N. Puchkin available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14073.
